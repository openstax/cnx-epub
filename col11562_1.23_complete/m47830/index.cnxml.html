It focuses on the interpretation of statistical results, especially in real world settings, and assumes that students have an understanding of intermediate algebra. In addition to end of section practice and homework sets, examples of each topic are explained step-by-step throughout the text and followed by a Try It problem that is designed as extra practice for students. This book also includes collaborative exercises and statistics labs designed to give students the opportunity to work together and explore key concepts. To support today&#8217;s student in understanding technology, this book features TI 83, 83+, 84, or 84+ calculator instructions at strategic points throughout. While the book has been built so that each chapter builds on the previous, it can be rearranged to accommodate any instructor&#8217;s particular needs.</div>

These innovative activities were developed by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean in order to offer students the experience of designing, implementing, and interpreting statistical analyses.  They are drawn from actual experiments and data-gathering processes and offer a unique hands-on and collaborative experience.  The labs provide a foundation for further learning and classroom interaction that will produce a meaningful application of statistics.  
</p>
<p id="eip-id1166298040766">Statistics Labs appear at the end of each chapter and begin with student learning outcomes, general estimates for time on task, and any global implementation notes.  Students are then provided with step-by-step guidance, including sample data tables and calculation prompts.  The detailed assistance will help the students successfully apply the concepts in the text and lay the groundwork for future collaborative or individual work.  </p></section>
