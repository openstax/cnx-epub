  <p id="element-667">By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:</p>
<ul id="list67">
  <li>Differentiate between Type I and Type II Errors</li>
<li>Describe hypothesis testing in general and in practice</li>
<li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation known.</li>
<li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation unknown.</li>
<li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population proportion.</li></ul>

<p id="delete_me">One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population. <span data-type="term">Confidence intervals</span> are one way to estimate a population parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to make a decision about a parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets 35 miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90% of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $60,000 per year.</p>
    <p id="element-818">A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called "<span data-type="term">hypothesis testing</span>." A hypothesis test involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then, the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis.</p><p id="element-224">In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions.
    You will also learn about the errors associated with these tests. </p>
  <p id="element-616">Hypothesis testing consists of two contradictory hypotheses or statements, a decision based on the data, and a conclusion. To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will:
</p><ol id="list-1"><li>Set up two contradictory hypotheses.</li>
<li>Collect sample data (in homework problems, the data or summary statistics will be given to you).</li>
<li>Determine the correct distribution to perform the hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow you to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion.</li>
</ol>
