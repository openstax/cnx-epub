    <p id="delete_me">When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes depending on the actual truth (or falseness) of the null hypothesis <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em> and the decision to reject or not. The outcomes are summarized in the following table:</p>

  <table id="element-689" summary=""><thead>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Reject <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em></strong></td>
    <td>Type I Error</td>
    <td>Correct Outcome</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
  <p id="element-915">The four possible outcomes in the table are:
    </p><ol id="list-1"><li>The decision is <strong>not to reject <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em></strong> when <strong><em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em> is true (correct decision).</strong></li>

      <li>The decision is to <strong>reject <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em></strong> when <strong><em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em> is true</strong> (incorrect decision known as a<span data-type="term">Type I error</span>).</li>

      <li>The decision is <strong>not to reject <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em></strong> when, in fact, <strong><em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em> is false</strong> (incorrect decision known as a <span data-type="term">Type II error</span>).</li>

      <li>The decision is to <strong>reject <em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em></strong> when <strong><em data-effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></em> is false</strong> (<strong>correct decision</strong> whose probability is called the <strong>Power of the Test</strong>).</li>
    </ol><p id="element-247">Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability.

In Massachusetts, the Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) monitors levels of the toxin in shellfish by regular sampling of shellfish along the coastline.

    <p id="eip-483">In every hypothesis test, the outcomes are dependent on a correct interpretation of the data. Incorrect calculations or misunderstood summary statistics can yield errors that affect the results. A <strong>Type I</strong> error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected. A <strong>Type II error</strong> occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.</p>
    <p id="eip-idm63626992">The probabilities of these errors are denoted by the Greek letters <em data-effect="italics">&#945;</em> and <em data-effect="italics">&#946;</em>, for a Type I and a Type II error respectively. The power of the test, 1 &#8211; <em data-effect="italics">&#946;</em>, quantifies the likelihood that a test will yield the correct result of a true alternative hypothesis being accepted. A high power is desirable.</p></section>
