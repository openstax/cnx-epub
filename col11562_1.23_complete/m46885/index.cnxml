<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="id7862377">Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like <m:math>
<m:mi>x</m:mi>
</m:math> or <m:math>
<m:mi>y</m:mi>
</m:math> generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:</para><list id="id10607985" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Qualitative</item>
<item>Quantitative</item>
</list>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="id9602938"><term>Qualitative data</term> are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called <term>categorical data</term>. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.</para><para id="id3365343"><term>Quantitative data</term> are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of <emphasis>counting</emphasis> or <emphasis>measuring</emphasis> attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either <term>discrete</term> or <term>continuous</term>.</para><para id="id9750754">All data that are the result of counting are called <term>quantitative discrete data</term>. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three.</para><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="id5023881">Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called <term>quantitative continuous data</term>. Continuous data are often  the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.</para><example id="fs-idm37037280"><title>Data Sample of Quantitative Discrete Data</title><para id="id3406867">The data are the number of books students carry in their backpacks.

<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="id12361474">Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. <emphasis>A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.</emphasis> Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods. There are several different methods of <emphasis>random sampling</emphasis>. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a <emphasis>simple random sample</emphasis>. Any group of <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected. For example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number, as in <link target-id="element-621" document=""/>:</para><table id="element-621" summary="This table presents a class roster arranged in alphabetical order.

</figure></note><para id="id11076554">Besides simple random sampling, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. <emphasis>Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the cluster sample, and the systematic sample.</emphasis></para>
<para id="id12511076">To choose a <emphasis>stratified sample</emphasis>, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a <emphasis>proportionate</emphasis> number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample.</para><para id="id13017093">To choose a <emphasis>cluster sample</emphasis>, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.</para><para id="id12769433">To choose a <emphasis>systematic sample</emphasis>, randomly select a starting point and take every <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis><sup>th</sup> piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.</para><para id="id12385449">A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. <emphasis>Convenience sampling</emphasis> involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.</para><para id="id10814456">Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.</para><para id="eip-781">True random sampling is done <emphasis>with replacement</emphasis>.  That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done <emphasis>without replacement</emphasis>. Surveys are typically done without replacement.  That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once.  Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.</para><para id="eip-277">In a college population of 10,000 people, suppose you want to pick a sample of

only when the population is small. For example, if the population is 25 people, the sample is ten, and

The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause <emphasis>nonsampling errors</emphasis>. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.</para>
<para id="fs-idp101680848">In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error.  As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.</para>
<para id="fs-idp40043264">In statistics, <emphasis>a sampling bias</emphasis> is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen).

We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include
</para><list id="eip-367"><item>Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid.</item>
<item>Self-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in
surveys, are often unreliable.</item>
<item>Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions</item>
<item>Undue influence:  collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response</item>
<item>Non-response or refusal of subject to participate:  The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population.  Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.</item>
<item>Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.</item>
<item>Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.</item>
<item>Misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context</item>
<item>Confounding:  When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated.  Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.</item>

The second sample is a group of senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest. The amount of money they spend on books is probably much less than the average parttime student. Both samples are biased.

A random sample is a representative group from the population chosen by using a method that gives each individual in the population an equal chance of being included in the sample. Random sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Convenience sampling is a nonrandom method of choosing a sample that often produces biased

However, an important factor is whether the Internet retailers actually have the textbooks that students need in stock.
