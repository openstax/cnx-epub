<p>This dot plot shows the results of a survey question. Repondents were
asked how many hours of sleep they get on average each night. The plot shows
hours of sleep on the X-axis, labeled in one-hour intervals from five to nine
hours, with the frequency of each response on the Y-axis. Each respondent is
represented by a single dot placed above the appropriate value for hours of
sleep. The results are as follows:</p>
<ul>

    night</li>
