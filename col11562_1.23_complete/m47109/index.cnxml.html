    <p id="delete_me">Before we take up the discussion of linear regression and correlation, we need to examine a way to display the relation between two variables <em data-effect="italics">x</em> and <em data-effect="italics">y</em>. The most common and easiest way is a <strong>scatter plot</strong>. The following example illustrates a scatter plot.</p>

<div data-type="example" id="element-777"><p id="element-622">In Europe and Asia, m-commerce is popular. M-commerce users have special mobile phones that work like electronic wallets as well as provide phone and Internet services. Users can do everything from paying for parking to buying a TV set or soda from a machine to banking to checking sports scores on the Internet. For the years 2000 through 2004, was
there a relationship between the year and the number of m-commerce users? Construct a scatter plot. Let <em data-effect="italics">x</em> = the year and let <em data-effect="italics">y</em> = the number of m-commerce users, in millions.</p>

<p id="element-83">A scatter plot shows the <strong>direction</strong> of a relationship between the variables. A clear direction happens when there is either:
</p><ul id="list1">
<li>High values of one variable occurring with high values of the other variable or low values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable.</li>
<li>High values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable.</li>
</ul>
<p id="element-674">You can determine the <strong data-effect="bold">strength</strong> of the relationship by looking at the scatter plot and seeing how close the points are to a line, a power function, an exponential function,
or to some other type of function.  For a linear relationship there is an exception. Consider a scatter plot where all the points fall on a horizontal line providing a "perfect fit." The horizontal line would in fact show no relationship.</p>

<p id="element-708">When you look at a scatterplot, you want to notice the <strong>overall pattern</strong> and any <strong>deviations</strong> from the pattern. The following scatterplot examples illustrate these concepts.</p>

<p id="element-243">In this chapter, we are interested in scatter plots that show a linear pattern. Linear patterns are quite common. The linear relationship is strong if the points are close to a straight line,  except in the case of a horizontal line where there is no relationship. If we think that the points show a linear relationship, we would like to draw a line on the scatter plot. This line can be calculated through a process called <span data-type="term">linear regression</span>. However, we only calculate a regression line if one of the variables helps to explain or predict the other variable. If <em data-effect="italics">x</em> is the independent variable and <em data-effect="italics">y</em> the dependent variable,
then we can use a regression line to predict <em data-effect="italics">y</em> for a given value of <em data-effect="italics">x</em></p><section data-depth="1" id="eip-407" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Chapter Review</h3>
<p id="fs-idm18585216">Scatter plots are particularly helpful graphs when we want to see if there is a linear relationship among data points. They indicate both the direction of the relationship between the <em data-effect="italics">x</em> variables and the <em data-effect="italics">y</em> variables, and the strength of the relationship. We calculate the strength of the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable using linear regression.</p></section>
